# MIT Election Data + Science Lab Hiring Exercise

Welcome to the Github of the MIT Election Data + Lab Hiring Exercise for a Senior Research Support Associate, exploring election data in Indiana.

For viewers, it's important to note that there are two main parts to this repository:

1. Original Exercise: this is a file containing all of the original exercise material performed between 1:00PM CST to 3:30PM CST.
2. Completed Exercise: this is a file containing all of the completed exercise material performed beyond 3:30PM CST. For my own intellectual curiosity, I have chosen to complete the exercise despite the completion of the assessment time. In fairness of judgement for all candidates of the position, I have chosen to upload any completed material beyond this time in a separate file to reduce any potential confusion for final assessment.
